# X-ray Image Classification: COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal Chest X-rays

## Introduction

This repository contains a deep learning model developed by Prakhar Biswas to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing an automated and accurate method to differentiate between these conditions using X-ray images.

## Features

- **Multi-class Classification**: Classifies X-ray images into COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal categories.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for transfer learning to achieve high accuracy.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface for running predictions on new X-ray images.
- **Data Augmentation**: Includes data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.
